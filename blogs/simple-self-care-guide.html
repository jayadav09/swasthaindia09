            <!-- Introduction -->
            <section class="mb-10">
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Think of it this way: you wouldn't expect your phone to function without charging it, yet we often expect ourselves to perform at 100% without ever taking time to recharge. These small, consistent actions are the secret to building resilience and preventing burnout. Here are 10 simple self-care practices that anyone can adopt, no matter how busy life gets.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- 1. Start with Intentionality -->
            <section class="mb-10">
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">1. Start with Intentionality, Not Your Inbox</h2>
                <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center gap-6">
                    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/805ad5/ffffff?text=Mindfulness" alt="A person meditating with serene look." class="rounded-2xl w-full sm:w-1/2 shadow-lg">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed sm:w-1/2">
                        The first five minutes of your day set the tone for the next 24 hours. Instead of immediately grabbing your phone and diving into emails and social media, try spending just five minutes in silence. This could be a simple deep breathing exercise or a short mindfulness practice where you focus on the present moment. This small shift helps you start the day from a place of calm and control, rather than reacting to the demands of the digital world.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- 2. Hydration -->
            <section class="mb-10">
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">2. Hydration is Your Brain's Best Friend</h2>
                <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6">
                    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/22c55e/ffffff?text=Stay+Hydrated" alt="A glass of water with lemon slices." class="rounded-2xl w-full sm:w-1/2 shadow-lg">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed sm:w-1/2">
                        You've heard it a million times, but it's worth repeating: water is crucial. Even mild dehydration can lead to brain fog, fatigue, and irritability. Make it a habit to keep a water bottle with you and sip throughout the day. If plain water feels boring, add a squeeze of lemon or some cucumber slices. This simple habit is an easy way to boost your energy, improve your mood, and sharpen your focus.
                    </p>

            <!-- 3. Protect Your Sleep -->
            <section class="mb-10">
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">3. Protect Your Sleep at All Costs</h2>
                <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center gap-6">
                    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/9ca3af/ffffff?text=Prioritize+Sleep" alt="A person sleeping peacefully in a comfortable bed." class="rounded-2xl w-full sm:w-1/2 shadow-lg">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed sm:w-1/2">
                        Sleep isn't a passive state; it's an active process where your body repairs itself and your brain consolidates memories and processes emotions. Aim for 7 to 8 hours of quality, uninterrupted rest. If you're struggling to fall asleep, try creating a wind-down routineâ€”things like reading a book, taking a warm bath, or listening to calming music can signal to your body that it's time to rest.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- 4. Take Movement Breaks -->
            <section class="mb-10">
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">4. Move Your Body, Free Your Mind</h2>
                <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6">
                    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/f59e0b/ffffff?text=Movement+Breaks" alt="A person stretching at their desk." class="rounded-2xl w-full sm:w-1/2 shadow-lg">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed sm:w-1/2">
                        Sitting for long periods can lead to physical stiffness and mental fatigue. Set an alarm to take a short movement break every hour. Stand up and stretch, walk to the kitchen for a glass of water, or do a few squats or jumping jacks. These micro-breaks aren't just good for your body; they also refresh your mind, helping you return to your work with renewed clarity.
                    </p>

            <!-- 5. Eat Balanced Meals -->
            <section class="mb-10">
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">5. Fuel Your Body with Purpose</h2>
                <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center gap-6">
                    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/dc2626/ffffff?text=Balanced+Meals" alt="A healthy, balanced meal with fruits and vegetables." class="rounded-2xl w-full sm:w-1/2 shadow-lg">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed sm:w-1/2">
                        The food you eat is a powerful tool for your health. While a quick snack is tempting, choosing a balanced meal with fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats gives your body the nutrients it needs to function properly. When you fuel yourself with high-quality foods, you'll feel more energetic and stable, which directly impacts your mental well-being.

            <!-- 6. Practice Gratitude -->
            <section class="mb-10">
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">6. Practice Gratitude, Cultivate Joy</h2>
                <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6">
                    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/38a169/ffffff?text=Gratitude+Journal" alt="A person writing in a journal with a pen." class="rounded-2xl w-full sm:w-1/2 shadow-lg">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed sm:w-1/2">
                        It's easy to get caught up in what's wrong or what's missing in our lives. A gratitude practice helps you intentionally shift your focus to what's right. Every day, take a minute to write down three things you are grateful for. They can be big or smallâ€”the sun shining, a good cup of coffee, or a kind word from a friend. This simple exercise can rewire your brain for happiness and resilience.

            <!-- 7. Digital Detox -->
            <section class="mb-10">
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">7. Schedule a Digital Sunset</h2>
                <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center gap-6">
                    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/3b82f6/ffffff?text=Digital+Detox" alt="A person setting aside their phone and picking up a book." class="rounded-2xl w-full sm:w-1/2 shadow-lg">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed sm:w-1/2">
                        Our brains are constantly stimulated by the glow of our screens. The blue light from phones and computers can interfere with your sleep cycle. Try setting a "digital curfew" an hour or two before bed. Use this time to read, journal, or simply sit with your thoughts. Disconnecting helps your brain calm down and prepare for a restful night.
                    </p>
                </div>

            <!-- 8. Connect with Loved Ones -->
            <section class="mb-10">
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">8. Nurture Your Connections</h2>
                <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6">
                    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/9333ea/ffffff?text=Connect+with+Loved+Ones" alt="Two friends laughing together over coffee." class="rounded-2xl w-full sm:w-1/2 shadow-lg">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed sm:w-1/2">
                        Humans are social creatures, and meaningful connections are vital for our well-being. A quick text message is great, but a real conversationâ€”either on the phone or in personâ€”can be even more powerful. Scheduling a regular call with a friend or a dinner with family helps to release feel-good hormones and combat feelings of loneliness or isolation.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- 9. Listen to Your Body -->
            <section class="mb-10">
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">9. Don't Ignore the Whispers</h2>
                <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center gap-6">
                    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/ef4444/ffffff?text=Listen+to+Your+Body" alt="A person putting a hand on their forehead, signaling fatigue." class="rounded-2xl w-full sm:w-1/2 shadow-lg">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed sm:w-1/2">
                        Our bodies and minds often send us subtle signals before we hit a wall. That persistent headache, the feeling of dread before a big meeting, or a sudden lack of motivation are all signs that you need to slow down. Don't push through it. Take a moment to check in with yourself. Listen to what your body is trying to tell you before it has to scream.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- 10. Schedule "Me-Time" -->
            <section class="mb-10">
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">10. Prioritize Your "Me-Time"</h2>
                <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-6">
                    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/facc15/ffffff?text=Me-Time" alt="A person reading a book alone in a cozy chair." class="rounded-2xl w-full sm:w-1/2 shadow-lg">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed sm:w-1/2">
                        Even 15 minutes a day dedicated solely to yourself can be a game-changer. This isn't about productivity; it's about pleasure and peace. Whether it's reading a chapter of a book, listening to your favorite song, or simply sitting in silence, this time is for you alone. Itâ€™s an opportunity to refuel your mental and emotional reserves.

            <!-- Conclusion -->

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">The Final Word</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mx-auto">
                    Self-care isn't a reward you earn after a long week; it's a practice you engage in daily to ensure you can show up as your best self. By taking care of your own needs, you become more resilient, more compassionate, and better equipped to handle life's challenges. It's not selfish; it's an act of self-preservation that benefits everyone around you. At SwasthaIndia, we believe that true health is holistic, and it starts with these small, powerful choices.
